# React + Vite Template

This template offers a streamlined setup for integrating React into Vite, complete with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and essential ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

To begin using this React + Vite template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/svvsaiteja/Internship-Selection-UnityLabs
   cd Internship-Selection-UnityLabs
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server at `http://localhost:5173/`. Open this URL in your browser to view your React application.

## Available Plugins

This template supports two official plugins for handling Fast Refresh:

1. **@vitejs/plugin-react**

   - Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
   - [Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)

2. **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**
   - Utilizes [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
   - [Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)

Choose the plugin that best fits your preferences and needs, and update your Vite configuration accordingly.

## Additional Configuration

Feel free to customize the ESLint rules to match your coding style. The ESLint configuration is included in the project, and you can modify it in the `.eslintrc.js` file.

## Build for Production

When your application is ready for production, you can generate an optimized build using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory containing the production-ready files.
